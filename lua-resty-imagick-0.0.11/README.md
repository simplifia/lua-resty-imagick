This library is under early development.

Installation
============

You'll need both LuaJIT (any version) and MagickWand.


To use ImageMagick, you might run:

On Ubuntu

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install libmagickwand-dev
```

On Centos

```bash
$ sudo yum install ImageMagick ImageMagick-devel
```

On MacOS
```bash
$ brew install imagemagick
```

It's recommended to use opm to install **lua-resty-imagick**.

```bash
$ opm get topalex/lua-resty-imagick
```
[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

Basic Usage
===========

If you just need to resize/crop an image, use the `thumb` function. It provides
a shorthand syntax for common operations.

```lua
local magick = require("resty.imagick")
magick.thumb("input.png", "100x100", "output.png")
```

The second argument to `thumb` is a size string, it can have the following
kinds of values:


```lua
"500x300"       -- Resize image such that the aspect ratio is kept,
                --  the width does not exceed 500 and the height does
                --  not exceed 300
"500x300!"      -- Resize image to 500 by 300, ignoring aspect ratio
"500x"          -- Resize width to 500 keep aspect ratio
"x300"          -- Resize height to 300 keep aspect ratio
"50%x20%"       -- Resize width to 50% and height to 20% of original
"500x300#"      -- Resize image to 500 by 300, but crop either top
                --  or bottom to keep aspect ratio
"500x300+10+20" -- Crop image to 500 by 300 at position 10,20
```

If you need more advanced image operations, you'll need to work with the
`Image` object. Read on.

Functions
=========

All functions contained in the table returned by `require("resty.imagick")`.

`thumb(input_fname, size_str, out_fname=nil)`
-----

Loads and resizes image. Write output to `out_fname` if provided, otherwise
return image blob. (`input_fname` can optionally be an instance of `Image`)

`load_image(fname)`
-----

Return a new `Image` instance, loaded from filename. Returns `nil` and error
message if image could not be loaded.

`load_image_from_blob(blob)`
-----

Loads an image from a Lua string containing the binary image data.

`Image` object
==============

Calling `load_image` or `load_image_from_blob` returns an `Image` object.


```lua
local magick = require "resty.imagick"

local img = assert(magick.load_image("hello.png"))

print("width:", img:get_width(), "height:", img:get_height());

img:resize(200, 200)
img:write("resized.png")
```

Images are automatically freed from memory by LuaJIT's garbage collector, but
images can take up a lot of space in memory when loaded so it's recommended to
call `destroy` on the image object as soon as possible.

Load ImageMagick directly:

```lua
magick = requrie "resty.imagick.wand"
local img = magick.load_image("some_image.png")
```

Auto enhance gamma.

`img:auto_level()`
-----
Auto enhance level.

`img:clut(clut, method)`
-----
Replaces colors in the image from a color lookup table.

`img:color_decision_list()`
-----
Accepts a lightweight Color Correction Collection (CCC) file which solely contains one or more color corrections and 
applies the color correction to the image. Here is a sample CCC file:

    <ColorCorrectionCollection xmlns="urn:ASC:CDL:v1.2">
    <ColorCorrection id="cc03345">
          <SOPNode>
               <Slope> 0.9 1.2 0.5 </Slope>

               <Saturation> 0.85 </Saturation>
          </SATNode>
    </ColorCorrection>
    </ColorCorrectionCollection>

which includes the offset, slope, and power for each of the RGB channels as well as the saturation.

`img:colorize(colorize, blend)`
-----
Blends the fill color with each pixel in the image.

`img:color_matrix(color_matrix)`
-----
Apply color transformation to an image. The method permits saturation changes, hue rotation, luminance to alpha, and 
various other effects. Although variable-sized transformation matrices can be used, typically one uses a 5x5 matrix for 
an RGBA image and a 6x6 for CMYKA (or RGBA with offsets). The matrix is similar to those used by Adobe Flash except 
offsets are in column 6 rather than 5 (in support of CMYKA images) and offsets are normalized (divide Flash offset by 255).

`img:combine(color_space)`
-----
Combines one or more images into a single image. The grayscale value of the pixels of each image in the sequence is 
assigned in order to the specified hannels of the combined image. The typical ordering would be image 1 => Red, 2 => Green, 3 => Blue, etc.

`img:comment(comment)`
-----
Adds a comment to your image.

`img:compare_layers(method)`
-----
Compares each image with the next in a sequence and returns the maximum bounding region of any pixel differences it discovers.

`img:composite_layers(source, compose, x, y)`
-----
Composite the images in the source wand over the images in the destination wand in sequence, starting with the current image in both lists.

Each layer from the two image lists are composted together until the end of one of the image lists is reached. 
The offset of each composition is also adjusted to match the virtual canvas offsets of each layer. As such the 
given offset is relative to the virtual canvas, and not the actual image.

Composition uses given x and y offsets, as the 'origin' location of the source images virtual canvas (not the real image) 
allowing you to compose a list of 'layer images' into the destiantioni images. This makes it well sutiable for 
directly composing 'Clears Frame Animations' or 'Coaleased Animations' onto a static or other 'Coaleased Animation' 
destination image list. GIF disposal handling is not looked at.

Special case:- If one of the image sequences is the last image (just a single image remaining), that image is 
repeatally composed with all the images in the other image list. Either the source or destination lists may be the single image, for this situation.

In the case of a single destination image (or last image given), that image will ve cloned to match the number of 
images remaining in the source image list.

This is equivelent to the "-layer Composite" Shell API operator.

`img:compare(reference, metric, distortion)`
-----
Compares an image to a reconstructed image and returns the specified difference image.

`img:composite_gravity(source, compose, gravity)`
-----
Composite one image onto another using the specified gravity.

`img:contrast(sharpen)`
-----
Enhances the intensity differences between the lighter and darker elements of the image. 
Set sharpen to a value other than 0 to increase the image contrast otherwise the contrast is reduced.

`img:contrast_stretch(black_point, white_point)`
-----
Enhances the contrast of a color image by adjusting the pixels color to span the entire range of colors available. 
You can also reduce the influence of a particular channel with a gamma value of 0.

`img:convolve(kernel)`
-----
Applies a custom convolution kernel to the image.

`img:cycle_colormap(displace)`
-----
Displaces an image's colormap by a given number of positions. 
If you cycle the colormap a number of times you can produce a psychodelic effect.

`img:constitute(columns, rows, map, storage, pixels)`
-----
Adds an image to the wand comprised of the pixel data you supply. The pixel data must be in scanline order top-to-bottom. 
The data can be char, short int, int, float, or double. Float and double require the pixels to be normalized [0..1], 
otherwise [0..Max], where Max is the maximum value the type can accomodate (e.g. 255 for char). 

`img:decipher(passphrase)`
-----
Converts cipher pixels to plain pixels.

`img:deconstruct()`
-----
Compares each image with the next in a sequence and returns the maximum bounding region of any pixel differences it discovers.

`img:deskew(threshold)`

imperfections in the scanning or surface, or simply because the paper was not placed completely flat when scanned.

`img:despeckle()`
-----
Reduces the speckle noise in an image while perserving the edges of the original image.

`img:display(server_name)`
-----
Displays an image.

`img:displays(server_name)`

`img:distort(method, num_args, args, bestfit)`
-----
Distorts an image using various distortion methods, by mapping color lookups of the source image to a new destination 
image usally of the same size as the source image, unless 'bestfit' is set to true.

If 'bestfit' is enabled, and distortion allows it, the destination image is adjusted to ensure the whole source 'image' 
will just fit within the final destination image, which will be sized and offset accordingly. 
Also in many cases the virtual offset of the source image will be taken into account in the mapping.

`img:draw(draw)`
-----
Renders the drawing wand on the current image.

`img:edge(radius)`
-----
Enhance edges within the image with a convolution filter of the given radius. 
Use a radius of 0 and Edge() selects a suitable radius for you.

`img:emboss(radius, sigma)`
-----
Returns a grayscale image with a three-dimensional effect. We convolve the image with a Gaussian operator of the given 
radius and standard deviation (sigma). For reasonable results, radius should be larger than sigma. 
Use a radius of 0 and Emboss() selects a suitable radius for you.

`img:encipher(passphrase)`
-----
Converts plaint pixels to cipher pixels.

`img:enhance()`
-----
Applies a digital filter that improves the quality of a noisy image.

`img:export_pixels(x, y, columns, rows, map, storage, pixels)`
-----
Extracts pixel data from an image and returns it to you. 
The method returns True on success otherwise False if an error is encountered. 
The data is returned as char, short int, int, ssize_t, float, or double in the order specified by map.

Suppose you want to extract the first scanline of a 640x480 image as character data in red-green-blue order:
img:export_pixels(0, 0, 640, 1, "RGB", "Char", pixels)

`img:extent(w, h, x, y)`
-----

Applys an arithmetic, relational, or logical expression to an image. Use these operators to lighten or darken an image, 
to increase or decrease contrast in an image, or to produce the "negative" of an image.

`img:fx(expression)`

and blue channels, or adjust all three with the gamma parameter. Values typically range from 0.8 to 2.3.

You can also reduce the influence of a particular channel with a gamma value of 0.

`img:gaussian_blur(radius, sigma)`
-----
Blurs an image. We convolve the image with a Gaussian operator of the given radius and standard deviation (sigma).

`img:liquid_rescale(columns, rows, delta_x, rigidity)`
-----
Rescales image with seam carving.

`img:local_contrast(radius, strenght)`
-----
Attempts to increase the appearance of large-scale light-dark transitions. Local contrast enhancement works similarly to 
sharpening with an unsharp mask, however the mask is instead created using an image with a greater blur distance.

`img:magnify()`
-----
A convenience method that scales an image proportionally to twice its original size.

`img:minify()`
-----
A convenience method that scales an image proportionally to one-half its original size.

`img:merge_layers(method)`
-----
Composes all the image layers from the current given image onward to produce a single image of the merged layers.

The inital canvas's size depends on the given LayerMethod, and is initialized using the first images background color. 
The images are then compositied onto that image in sequence using the given composition that has been assigned to 
each individual image.

`img:montage(drawing, tile_geometry, thumbnail_geometry, mode, frame)`
-----
Creates a composite image by combining several separate images. The images are tiled on the composite image with 
the name of the image optionally appearing just below the individual tile.

`img:morph(num_frames)`
-----
Method morphs a set of images. Both the image pixels and size are linearly interpolated to give the appearance of 
a meta-morphosis from one image to the next.

`img:morphology(method, iterations, kernel)`
-----
Applies a user supplied kernel to the image according to the given mophology method.

`img:motion_blur(radius, sigma, angle)`
-----
Simulates motion blur. We convolve the image with a Gaussian operator of the given radius and standard deviation (sigma). 
For reasonable results, radius should be larger than sigma. Use a radius of 0 and MotionBlurImage() 
selects a suitable radius for you. Angle gives the angle of the blurring motion.

`img:negate(gray)`
-----
Negates the colors in the reference image. The Grayscale option means that only grayscale values within the image are negated.

You can also reduce the influence of a particular channel with a gamma value of 0.

`img:new_image(columns, rows, background)`
-----
Adds a blank image canvas of the specified size and background color to the wand.

`img:next()`
-----
Sets the next image in the wand as the current image.

It is typically used after reset_iterator(), after which its first use will set the first image as the current image (unless the wand is empty).

It will return False when no more images are left to be returned which happens when the wand is empty, or the current image is the last image.

When the above condition (end of image list) is reached, the iterator is automaticall set so that you can start using 
previous() to again iterate over the images in the reverse direction, starting with the last image (again). You can 
jump to this condition immeditally using set_last_iterator().

`img:normalize()`
-----
Enhances the contrast of a color image by adjusting the pixels color to span the entire range of colors available

You can also reduce the influence of a particular channel with a gamma value of 0.

-----
Applies a special effect filter that simulates an oil painting. Each pixel is replaced by the 
most frequent color occurring in a circular region defined by radius.

`img:opaque_paint(target, fill, fuzz, invert)`
-----
Changes any pixel that matches color with the color defined by fill.

`img:optimize_layers()`
-----
Compares each image the GIF disposed forms of the previous image in the sequence. From this it attempts to select the 
smallest cropped image to replace each frame, while preserving the results of the animation.

`img:optimize_transparency()`
-----
Takes a frame optimized GIF animation, and compares the overlayed pixels against the disposal image resulting from 
all the previous frames in the animation. Any pixel that does not change the disposal image (and thus does not effect the outcome of an overlay) is made transparent.

WARNING: This modifies the current images directly, rather than generate a new image sequence.
 
`img:ordered_dither(threshold_map)`

Performs an ordered dither based on a number of pre-defined dithering threshold maps, but over multiple intensity levels, 
which can be different for different channels, according to the input arguments.

Tiles 9 thumbnails of the specified image with an image processing operation applied at varying strengths. 
This helpful to quickly pin-point an appropriate parameter for an image processing operation.

`img:previous()`
-----
Sets the previous image in the wand as the current image.

It is typically used after set_last_iterator(), after which its first use will set the last image as the current image (unless the wand is empty).

It will return False when no more images are left to be returned which happens when the wand is empty, or the current 
image is the first image. At that point the iterator is than reset to again process images in the forward direction, 
again starting with the first image in list. Images added at this point are prepended.

Also at that point any images added to the wand using add() or read() will be prepended before the first image. 
In this sense the condition is not quite exactly the same as reset_iterator().

`img:quantize(num_corlors, colorspace, treedepth, method, measure_error)`
